# Modeling Privacy Policies
This repo presents models of privacy policies for smart watches developed within the BMBF-funded InvIDas project (https://invidas.gi.de/). Within the InviDas project, we ensure that users of smart wearables, such as fitness watches, will have better insight into their data profiles and will be able to make informed decisions more easily.
